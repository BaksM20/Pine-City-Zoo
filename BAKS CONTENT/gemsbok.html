                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>The gemsbok is a large antelope native to arid regions of Southern Africa. It is known for its striking appearance, with long, straight horns and distinct black-and-white facial markings.</p>
                <p>Gemsbok are well adapted to desert life and can survive without water for long periods, obtaining moisture from the plants they eat.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: Gemsbok can raise their body temperature to avoid sweating and conserve water, a rare adaptation among mammals. Their striking horns are used for defense and can reach up to 85 cm in length!</p>
                <p>Conservation note: While gemsbok populations are stable in many areas, habitat loss and hunting can pose threats. Zoos and reserves play a key role in their protection and education.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                <p>You will find the gemsbok in the open plains area of the zoo, near the giraffe enclosure.</p>
