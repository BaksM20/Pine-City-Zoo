                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>The giraffe is the tallest land animal, famous for its long neck and legs. Giraffes are native to Africa and are known for their gentle nature and unique appearance.</p>
                <p>Giraffes feed mainly on leaves from tall trees, especially acacias, and can spot predators from far away due to their height. Their long tongues and prehensile lips help them grasp leaves and twigs.</p>
                <p>Each giraffe has a unique pattern of spots, much like a human fingerprint. They live in loose herds and are generally peaceful animals.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: A giraffeâ€™s tongue can be up to 45 cm long and is prehensile, allowing it to grasp leaves and twigs with ease. Giraffes only need to drink once every few days, as they get most of their water from plants.</p>
                <p>Conservation note: Giraffe populations are declining in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching. Conservation efforts are underway to protect these gentle giants and their habitats.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                <p>The giraffes are located in the savannah section of the zoo, close to the gemsbok enclosure.</p>
