                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>The giant panda is a bear native to south central China. It is easily recognized by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.</p>
                <p>Pandas are known for their love of bamboo, which makes up most of their diet.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: Despite their bulk, pandas are excellent climbers and can swim! A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter and is born pink and blind.</p>
                <p>Conservation note: Giant pandas were once endangered, but thanks to conservation efforts, their status has improved. Continued habitat protection is vital for their future.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                <p>The pandas are located in the bamboo forest section of the zoo.</p>
