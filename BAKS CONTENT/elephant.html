                            <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
    <p>The elephant is the largest land animal on Earth. Gentle giants of the jungle, elephants are known for their intelligence, memory, and strong social bonds.</p>
    <p>All elephants have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is a long trunk or proboscis, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects. Their incisors grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants' large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their pillar-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.</p>
    <p>Did you know? Elephants are capable of complex emotions like joy, playfulness, and even grief. They have been observed comforting each other and are known to recognize themselves in mirrors, a sign of high intelligence.</p>
   <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
