                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>The warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in grassland, savanna, and woodland in sub-Saharan Africa. Warthogs are known for their distinctive tusks and facial warts.</p>
                <p>They are tough, adaptable animals that can survive in harsh environments and are often seen kneeling while grazing.</p>
                <p>Fun fact: Warthogs use their tusks and snouts to dig for food and create burrows. They often back into their burrows to face outward, ready to defend against predators!</p>
                <p>Conservation note: Warthogs are not currently endangered, but they rely on healthy grasslands and water sources. Protecting their habitats helps ensure their survival.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</p></strong>
                <p>The warthogs are located near the open plains area of the zoo.</p>
